/// Comprehensive configuration container for portal transition animations.
///
/// This struct serves as the main configuration object that encapsulates all the settings
/// needed to customize a portal animation. It combines animation timing parameters with
/// visual styling options to provide complete control over the transition appearance.
///
/// The configuration is designed to be immutable and reusable across multiple portal
/// transitions, promoting consistency in animation behavior throughout an application.
///
/// **Usage Pattern:**
/// - Create once, use multiple times for consistent animations
/// - Pass to portal initialization or update methods
/// - Combine with different portal IDs for varied but consistent transitions
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// let config = PortalTransitionConfig(
///     animation: PortalAnimation(.spring(duration: 0.5), delay: 0.1, duration: 0.5),
///     corners: PortalCorners(source: 8, destination: 16, style: .continuous)
/// )
///
/// // Use with portal animation
/// portalTransition(id: "myPortal", config: config)
/// ```
