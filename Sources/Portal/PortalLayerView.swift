/// Internal overlay view responsible for rendering and animating portal transition layers.
///
/// This view serves as the main rendering engine for portal animations. It creates an overlay
/// that displays intermediate animation layers during portal transitions, handling the smooth
/// movement and scaling between source and destination positions.
///
/// The view uses a `GeometryReader` to access coordinate space information needed for
/// calculating precise positions and sizes during animations. It manages multiple concurrent
/// portal animations through the shared `CrossModel`.
///
/// **Architecture:**
/// - Uses `GeometryReader` to access coordinate space for position calculations
/// - Iterates through all active portal animations in the model
/// - Delegates individual animation rendering to `PortalLayerContentView`

    /// Creates individual `PortalLayerContentView` instances for each active portal animation,
    /// passing the geometry proxy for coordinate calculations. The `@Bindable` wrapper allows
    /// the individual content views to modify portal state directly.
    ///

/// This view is responsible for rendering one specific portal transition, including:
/// - Animating the layer view between source and destination positions
/// - Managing the animation lifecycle and cleanup
/// - Handling size and position interpolation during transitions
/// - Executing completion callbacks at appropriate times
///
/// **Animation Lifecycle:**
/// 1. Layer appears at source position/size when animation starts
/// 2. Animates smoothly to destination position/size
/// 3. Handles cleanup and state reset after animation completes
/// 4. Calls completion handlers to notify the system of animation status

    /// positions and sizes based on the current animation state.

    /// - Source anchor must be available (source view positioned)
    /// - Destination anchor must be available (destination view positioned)
    /// - Layer view must be provided (transition content)
    /// - View must not be hidden (`!info.hideView`)

    /// **Animation Interpolation:**
    /// - Position: Animates from source minX/minY to destination minX/minY
    /// - Size: Animates from source width/height to destination width/height
    /// - Uses `info.animateView` flag to determine current target values
    ///

    /// - Uses `proxy[anchor]` to convert anchor bounds to global coordinates
    /// - Positions layer using `.offset()` for precise placement
    /// - Uses `.frame()` for size animation
